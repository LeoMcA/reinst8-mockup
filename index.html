        <p>Guided by a firm belief in the paramount importance of privacy in the Digital Age, we look to elevate the debate on this complex, subtle matter to a national level so that — in true democratic fashion — we the people can decide on where and how to strike the balance between security and privacy. As recent revelations concerning GCHQ's involvement in PRISM, its own Tempora program, and the current proposal for an over-bearing, opt-out and ineffective internet filtering system have demonstrated, privacy is fast becoming a thing of the past. Civil liberty is being eroded away from under our feet by the heavy-handed, lazy and dangerous steps taken by those in power. These problems won't go away on their own: only by standing united in opposition, by demanding privacy and rejecting censorship in all its forms will we have a chance.</p>

        <p>Join #Reinst8 today and campaign for the future of the Internet, of digital freedom and of personal privacy. It's not too late, but we must act now.</p>
